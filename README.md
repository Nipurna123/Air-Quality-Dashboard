#  Air Quality Monitoring with Machine Learning

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that simulates air quality monitoring, performs data analysis, and applies machine learning models to classify and cluster air quality index (AQI) levels.

##  Features
-  **Data Simulation**: Generates synthetic air quality dataset with pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.  
-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Correlation heatmap of pollutants and AQI  
  - Distribution of AQI categories  
-  **Machine Learning**:  
  - **KMeans Clustering** for grouping pollution patterns  
  - **Decision Tree Classifier** for AQI category prediction  
-  **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Confusion matrix  
  - Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score
